Our recreation centre offers a variety of features, including both an indoor and outdoor pool! Physical activity and a healthy lifestyle is very important to us. That's why no matter the season, you can count on the Ottawa Carleton Community Pool to deliver good, clean fun!</p>

A lifeguard is always situated at both our pools for the safety of the patrons. We do daily inspections around our pool areas to ensure everything is always working properly and safely. We also offer complementary change rooms, saunas, and whirl pool areas to all of our members.</p>
